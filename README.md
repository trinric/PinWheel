 A Pinterest Posting Cooldown Manager

Uses Meteor.js as a full stack framework.

This program was largely made obselete by a larger company releasing a similar project around the same time. It was designed for small businesses who were trying to schedule posts on pinterest to avoid being flagged as a bot/company and game the cooldown.
